Using the kdb+ C API
======================================

Example of how to use the [C API for kdb](http://www.timestored.com/kdb-guides/kdb-c-api-example) to:

 - Query a kdb server process from C
 - Subscribe to a kdb+ Tickerplant
 - Write a Feedhandler

It is a simple example only and does not contain good logging, failover etc.
