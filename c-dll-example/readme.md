Calling C code from kdb+
======================================

The code demonstrates [compiling and loading a c dll for kdb](http://www.timestored.com/kdb-guides/compile-load-c-dll).

It shows how to:
 - Compile a DLL on windows
 - Load the library within kdb
 - Calling the C function from kdb

It is a simple example only and does not contain good logging, argument checking etc.
